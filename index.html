  <h1>JavaScript fundamentals with Bob Tabor</h1>
  <p>
    Microsoft MVP Bob Tabor, founder of Developer University, walks you through the “what,”
    “how,” and “why" of JavaScript. </p>
  <p>
    We begin with the very basics of the JavaScript language, and learn everything you need to know to get started.
    Watch
    lots of helpful demos, as Bob explores the fundamentals — from getting the tools, setting up the development
    environment, and exploring expressions, operators, and arrays, to options, classes, functions, and actually writing
    code. Each concept in this course is broken into its own video so you can search for and focus on the information
    you need. And Bob offers lots of encouragement and tips along the way.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>01 | Introduction</li>
    Get an introduction from Bob, as he kicks off the course, sets expectations, and gives you a little guidance for
    the road ahead.
    <li>02 | Setting Up the Development Environment. 11:38</li>
    See how to install Node and Visual Studio Code, and learn why you need each. Watch as Bob writes a first tiny line
    of code to make sure that the installation is ready.
    <li>03 | Basic JavaScript Syntax. 23:53</li>
    Hear about the basics of the JavaScript syntax, including how JavaScript is executed, how to create a properly
    formed statement, and more.
    <li>04 | Variables 37:14</li>
    Learn what variables are and how to declare, initialize, set, and get values from them.
    <li>05 | Data Types 51:49</li>
    JavaScript works with data types differently than other programming languages do. Learn from Bob as he explains
    some of the most basic data types and how to determine the type held by a variable.
    <li>06 | Type Coercion and Conversion 57:34</li>
    Sometimes you need to explicitly convert the data type of a value into a different data type. Sometimes JavaScript
    will do this automatically for you. Bob explains how and why this happens.
    <li>07 | Expressions and Operators 1:06:25</li>
    Learn how to spot a well-formed expression and how to compose expressions through the combination of operators and
    operands.
    <li>08 | Arrays 1:23:40</li>
    Watch as Bob demonstrates how to use arrays, how to add/remove elements of an array, how to access elements of an
    array using the index, how to get the number of elements in an array, and more.
    <li>09 | Function Declaration 1:34:54</li>
    Get an introduction to functions, as Bob shows you one way to define a function, how to call the function, how to
    pass parameters into a function, how to return values from a function, and more.
    <li>10 | Function Expressions 1:44:41</li>
    Sometimes a function declaration is more than you need. Get details in this lesson, as Bob demonstrates how to use
    a function expression and how to create an immediately invoked function expression.
    <li>11 | Decision Statements 1:56:44</li>
    Learn how to add logic to your applications by testing conditions using if / else statements, switch / case
    statements, and the ternary operator.
    <li>12 | Iteration Statements 2:11:29</li>
    Watch as Bob introduces the For and While statements, which enable you to loop through lists of values and perform
    operations on them.
    <li>13 | Basics of Scope 2:23:54</li>
    Hear an explanation of the notion of the lifetime of variables and their reach into other code blocks, in this
    discussion of scope.
    <li>14 | Returning Functions from Functions 2:31:41</li>
    As a building block toward a more sophisticated approach to building JavaScript applications, see how you can
    return functions from functions.
    <li>15 | Object Literals 2:41:58</li>
    Objects contain properties and functions that describe attributes of the object and its behavior, respectively.
    Watch as Bob demonstrates how to create object literals.
    <li>16 | Module Pattern and Revealing Module Pattern 3:02:26</li>
    Learn how to introduce variables and functions without leaving an unnecessarily large footprint on the global
    scope.
    <li>17 | Closures 3:20:31</li>
    Closures allow developers to bind functions to their execution context, including variables, so you can build
    specialized versions of functions. Learn how closures work and how to create them.
